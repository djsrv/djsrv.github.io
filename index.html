						This week my focus was on our first XObject, FileIO, which allows Lingo to read/write files:
set file = FileIO(mNew, &quot;write&quot;, &quot;foo.txt&quot;) file(mWriteString, &quot;Hello, world!&quot; &amp; RETURN) file(mDispose) Relatively simple, so FileIO itself didn&rsquo;t take long to implement. After that was done, I spent most of the week hunting down and fixing bugs and missing Lingo features in two major FileIO examples, The Apartment&rsquo;s Saving Text and Spaceship Warlock.
Funnily enough, I managed to find more scripts that weren&rsquo;t being loaded, and of course, The Journeyman Project was hiding more syntax errors that revealed themselves once these scripts were properly handled:&hellip;

						&ldquo;An important room, this!&rdquo; cried Mr. Wonka, taking a bunch of keys from his pocket and slipping one into the keyhole of the door. &ldquo;This is the nerve center of the whole factory, the heart of the whole business! And so beautiful! I insist upon my rooms being beautiful! I can&rsquo;t abide ugliness in factories! In we go, then! But do be careful, my dear children! Don&rsquo;t lose your heads! Don&rsquo;t get overexcited!&hellip;

						The first official day of coding has just ended!
I spent the last 9 days before this one driving from New Jersey to Arizona and back, so no progress to report on except this first official day, which I spent implementing Lingo factories and ironing out kinks in my workstation. Now Lingo supports creating factories and calling methods on them, and tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be implementing default methods, instance variables, parent scripts, and whatever else pops up.&hellip;

						School&rsquo;s out, Summer of Code prep has begun! This past week:
 I&rsquo;ve been reading and re-reading the code for ScummVM&rsquo;s Lingo subsystem to improve my mental map of it, and I&rsquo;ve been making small fixes when I catch problems. I collected some of the documentation I encountered in my past adventures with Director. A ton of interesting information on Director&rsquo;s file format in there! I set up a shelf next to my desk and turned it into my obsolete Macromedia products library (mostly Director books, of course).&hellip;

						Hi! I&rsquo;m Dylan Servilla, and this summer I&rsquo;m going to be working on ScummVM&rsquo;s Macromedia Director engine as a GSoC student. Director was used to create a ton of multimedia from the late &rsquo;80s to early &rsquo;00s, and I think it&rsquo;s important that we save this digital history from software rot. In particular, I hope to help the engine reach full support for Spaceship Warlock and The Journeyman Project in the near future.&hellip;

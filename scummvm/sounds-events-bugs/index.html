			<p>This last week was a busy one, with my focus split between three main tasks.</p>
<p>The first two days, I played through the beginning of <em>Spaceship Warlock</em>, identifying and fixing any Lingo issues. I quickly got frustrated with not being able to hear the game&rsquo;s dialogue, so I improved our decoder for Macintosh <code>snd </code> resources so that it could handle <em>Warlock</em>&rsquo;s sounds:</p>

<p>The next day, I focused on event handling: fixing some strange bugs, and then rewriting most of our event code to allow for proper event delegation. Only one object is supposed to handle each event—sometimes a sprite, sometimes a cast member, sometimes the frame, and sometimes the movie. I still haven&rsquo;t perfected the process of determining which object it should be in every case, but the new system is a heck of a lot better than before, when we were just firing off the event to everything that could possibly handle it.</p>
<p>For the rest of the week, I began implementing parent scripts, Lingo&rsquo;s second iteration of object-oriented programming. With factories already implemented, this was relatively easy, but the test movies I&rsquo;ve been working with, the object-oriented bug examples from <em>Lingo Workshop</em>, have been surprisingly hard to get working, using all sorts of uncommon Lingo features. Our implementations of many of these features were buggy, to say the least, and I&rsquo;ve been slowly working through them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve finally squashed enough of the bad type of bug to get the good type to display! Still, there&rsquo;s plenty of work to do, which I will get to tomorrow.</p>

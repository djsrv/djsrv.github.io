			<p>This last week I got some boring but important work done. After completing some odd jobs like implementing event delegation for Director 2-3 and TrueType font loading, I began refactoring the Director engine to make it flexible enough to handle Movies In A Window (MIAWs), or multiple movies running in parallel.</p>
<p>For those not familiar, Director uses a movie metaphor for development. A movie&rsquo;s major components are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cast, which contains cast members. Cast members can be visual (such as bitmaps or text), they can be sounds, or they can be scripts.</li>
<li>The stage, where sprites (instances of cast members) are displayed.</li>
<li>The score, a sequence of frames which dictate sprite placement, sounds, script execution, and much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, all these jobs were handled by an enormous Score class. This worked fine when we were only playing one movie at a time, but to support MIAWs, things needed to be a whole lot more modular. Nathanael separated rendering code into a Stage class, while I separated the Cast and Movie from the Score, which took quite a long time.</p>
<p>After that, I began working on displaying movies within our classic Mac Window manager.</p>

<p>Today I began implementing the Lingo side of MIAWs, so I hope to have more news on them soon!</p>

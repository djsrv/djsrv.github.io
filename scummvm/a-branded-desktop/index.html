			<p>It&rsquo;s been a hectic week since I attended two online conferences going on at the same time, and I had to prepare a talk for one of them, but I still have some exciting progress to share!</p>
<p>This week I got desktop/window border textures working, so the environment surrounding the Director movies looks closer to how it would have back in the day. Though the ScummVM branding would&rsquo;ve been Mac OS branding, of course.

<p>This was a real pain to get to, since I needed to make all these textures myself, and our MacWindowManager&rsquo;s hard-coded defaults never work quite right for the Director engine&rsquo;s use cases. But now it (mostly) works. I just need to fix up a few bugs and rewrite the desktop background code to make it more efficient.</p>
<p>On Friday, we met with John Henry Thomspon, the inventor of Lingo, to show off this and our other progress. It&rsquo;s always nice to hear the thoughts of such an important Director developer. :)</p>
<p>I also rewrote my Lingo decompiler, <a href="https://github.com/Earthquake-Project/ProjectorRays">ProjectorRays</a>, in C++ so that it can more easily share code with ScummVM, and I&rsquo;m working to bring it in line with the Lingo discoveries we&rsquo;ve made while working on the Director engine. I just got it working on Director 4 movies! The output for these older movies isn&rsquo;t great yet, but that will quickly change.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;An important room, this!&rdquo; cried Mr. Wonka, taking a bunch of keys from his pocket and slipping one into the keyhole of the door. &ldquo;<em>This</em> is the nerve center of the whole factory, the heart of the whole business! And so <em>beautiful</em>! I <em>insist</em> upon my rooms being beautiful! I can&rsquo;t <em>abide</em> ugliness in factories! <em>In</em> we go, then! But <em>do</em> be careful, my dear children! Don&rsquo;t lose your heads! Don&rsquo;t get overexcited! Keep very calm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wonka opened the door. Five children and nine grownups pushed their ways in—and, <em>oh</em>, what an amazing sight it was that now met their eyes!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, the Director 2 Simple Factory example now runs in ScummVM (with some modifications to account for broken button rendering)! I had to implement several Lingo features for this movie, but the most important is, of course, factories, which are essentially Lingo&rsquo;s first iteration of object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a snippet from the <code>ballBoy</code> factory used in this movie:</p>
<pre><code>factory ballBoy

method mNew n, entry
    instance ballNum,  spriteNum, count, entryNum

    set entryNum = entry
    set count = 0
    set ballNum = n 
    set spriteNum = n + 1
</code></pre><p>When the button in the bottom-right corner is clicked, a new <code>ballBoy</code> object is created and associated with a ball sprite. This object becomes the control center of the sprite, giving it logic that keeps track of how many times it&rsquo;s been clicked, changing its appearance, and allowing it to be dragged around.</p>
<p>Factories are used extensively throughout <em>Spaceship Warlock</em>, so now that they&rsquo;re implemented, I&rsquo;ll be working directly on that game in the near future.</p>
<p>Besides factories, this week I implemented numerous event-handling features, and I discovered and fixed a bug that prevented certain scripts in Director 2 and 3 movies from being loaded. This caused a horrifying amount of unhandled Lingo syntax in <em>The Journeyman Project</em> to suddenly reveal itself:

<p>Luckily, sev has now fixed all of those errors.</p>
<p>Onward to more Lingo!</p>

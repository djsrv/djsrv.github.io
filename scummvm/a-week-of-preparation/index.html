			<p>School&rsquo;s out, Summer of Code prep has begun! This past week:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been reading and re-reading the code for ScummVM&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/tree/master/engines/director/lingo">Lingo subsystem</a> to improve my mental map of it, and I&rsquo;ve been making <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/commits?author=djsrv">small fixes</a> when I catch problems.</li>
<li>I collected some of the <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Director#File_Format">documentation</a> I encountered in my past adventures with Director. A ton of interesting information on Director&rsquo;s file format in there!</li>
<li>I set up a shelf next to my desk and turned it into my obsolete Macromedia products library (mostly Director books, of course).
<img src="/img/macromedia-library.jpg" alt="Shelf of Macromedia Director books"></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been reading up on Lingo&rsquo;s factories and parent scripts, two different object systems and the eventual basis for Director&rsquo;s XObjects and Xtras.</li>
<li>I did some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bsq80TFdz38Ib2W0O8YfAazNe2SrPEgWIKheb5GV1KI/edit">planning</a> for the implementation of these object systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow sev and I are going to meet with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thompson_(inventor)">John Henry Thomspon</a>, the inventor of Lingo, to discuss the implementation of factories! I grew up playing Shockwave (for Director) games, and I&rsquo;ve spent a good deal of time hacking with their Lingo bytecode, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to meeting the man himself.</p>
<p>I should probably elaborate on my history with Director. I&rsquo;m currently 19, so I only caught the tail end of Shockwave gaming, and I mostly played Flash games. I got interested in how web games worked in 2013-2014, and there were some fantastic, user-friendly tools for peering into the inner workings of Flash <code>.swf</code> files, such as <a href="https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler">JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler (FFDEC)</a>. However, every so often I&rsquo;d encounter a Director <code>.dcr</code> file, and there were no good tools for these. I wasn&rsquo;t capable enough to do the necessary reverse engineering myself, so for the next few years, I gave up on Director.</p>
<p>In 2017, I came across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNQ2XwRcbmM">YouTube video</a> about a lost Director game that some people were interested in finding, &ldquo;Jimmy Neutron: Gotta Blast! Rocket Race&rdquo;. I decided to look for the game, and I found a subdomain of nick.com that mirrored the website as it was sometime in the mid 2000s. Within a couple minutes, I found the landing page for the game on that subdomain. However, the page required you to log in with a Nick ID to get to the game, and the signup page no longer worked. I thought I&rsquo;d hit a dead end, but then I remembered I&rsquo;d already signed up for a Nick ID about 10 years before, in my early days on the web. I began guessing combinations of old usernames and passwords until I got to the game, I posted it on the 3D Groove Grove Discord server, and now my crowning achievement is having my Discord alias &lsquo;kaj&rsquo; listed as the game&rsquo;s discoverer on its <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Jimmy_Neutron:_Gotta_Blast!_Rocket_Race_(partially_found_online_game;_2002)">Lost Media Wiki article</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after I posted the game files, the 3D Groove Grove users discovered that the game was incomplete, missing most of the levels that were advertised in commercials. I wanted to poke around the game to see what was up, but at that point the tools for working with Director files were still extremely limited. With some searching, I found a primitive Lingo disassembler called <a href="https://github.com/Brian151/OpenShockwave/tree/master/tools/lscrtoscript">ProjectorRays</a> that tomysshadow, the admin of the 3D Groove Grove server, had been working on. I asked him about it, and he invited me to the OpenShockwave Discord server, where people were reverse engineering Director with eventual plans to build an open-source replacement for the Shockwave player. I picked up work on ProjectorRays, and I took it from a half-working Lingo disassembler to a mostly-working decompiler. Soon OpenShockwave became the Earthquake Project, and progress on Lingo decompilation continued with <a href="https://github.com/Earthquake-Project/Shockky/">Shockky</a>, but everything else stalled.</p>
<p>Three years later, I still wanted to work on an open-source Director reimplementation, so here I am now at ScummVM. :)</p>

			<p>This week my focus was on our first XObject, FileIO, which allows Lingo to read/write files:</p>
<pre><code>set file = FileIO(mNew, &quot;write&quot;, &quot;foo.txt&quot;)
file(mWriteString, &quot;Hello, world!&quot; &amp; RETURN)
file(mDispose)
</code></pre><p>Relatively simple, so FileIO itself didn&rsquo;t take long to implement. After that was done, I spent most of the week hunting down and fixing bugs and missing Lingo features in two major FileIO examples, <em>The Apartment</em>&rsquo;s Saving Text and <em>Spaceship Warlock</em>.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I managed to find more scripts that weren&rsquo;t being loaded, and of course, <em>The Journeyman Project</em> was hiding more syntax errors that revealed themselves once these scripts were properly handled:</p>
<p><img src="/img/jman-failure2.png" alt="Many more failed tests in the Journeyman Project"></p>
<p><em>Journeyman</em> is a treasure trove of syntax errors. :)</p>
<p>Now that all those problems are addressed, I&rsquo;m proud to announce that <em>Spaceship Warlock</em> can now save and load games!</p>

<p>This will allow us to progress through the game in more than one sitting, making testing the whole thing much easier.</p>
<p>This coming week I&rsquo;m planning to identify and implement more missing Lingo throughout the game, hopefully bringing it to a much more playable state. See you in a week or so with news on that!</p>

			<p>Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve made 451 commits to the main ScummVM repository, largely in the Macromedia Director and MacGUI subsystems:</p>
<p><img src="/img/scummvm-commits.png" alt="451 commits to ScummVM"></p>
<p>Most of this work was focused on the reimplementation of Lingo, Director&rsquo;s programming language, so that Director games can be played in ScummVM. <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/commits?author=djsrv">You can find every commit here</a>, but this is the overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>I did extensive work on Lingo objects;
<ul>
<li>I implemented <a href="https://djsrv.github.io/scummvm/charlie-and-the-object-factory/">factories</a>, Lingo&rsquo;s first iteration of objects.</li>
<li>I wrote a simple framework for XObjects (external objects). I started by implementing the <a href="https://djsrv.github.io/scummvm/fileio-fun/">FileIO</a> XObject, and several XObjects have now been implemented by other contributors.</li>
<li>I implemented <a href="https://djsrv.github.io/scummvm/back-to-bytecode/">parent/child scripts</a>, the successor to factories.</li>
<li>I wrote a template that allows any class to expose Lingo properties and methods, now used on scripts, windows, and cast members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I did extensive work to make our Lingo implementation more robust, including:
<ul>
<li>Refactoring the grammar, reducing its hundreds of conflicts to just a handful</li>
<li>Properly differentiating between commands and functions</li>
<li>Implementing Lingo errors</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I improved reading Director movies from file:
<ul>
<li>I identified and wrote code to handle quite a few previously understudied parts of the file format.</li>
<li>I implemented a reader for Macintosh sound resources.</li>
<li>I added support for loading <a href="https://djsrv.github.io/scummvm/shockwave/">Shockwave movies</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I implemented many minor Lingo features.</li>
<li>I rewrote the Lingo event system so that events are correctly ordered and delegated across multiple concurrent movies.</li>
<li>I refactored the monolithic Score class into a Movie, a Score, and a Cast, making the engine more faithful to Director and improving maintainability.</li>
<li>I implemented <a href="https://djsrv.github.io/scummvm/miaws/">Movies In A Window</a> (MIAWs), adding support for multiple concurrent movies.</li>
<li>I recreated the looks of the <a href="https://djsrv.github.io/scummvm/a-branded-desktop/">Mac System 7 desktop</a> to go with MIAWs.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the work I&rsquo;ve done this summer, in combination with the other team members&rsquo; efforts, the Director engine is much more robust and has a greatly enhanced feature set. It can run a decent subset of Director 2-4 movies, but there is still plenty of work to be done to ensure feature completeness and to support later versions. I plan to stick around to help with this.</p>
<p>In addition, while my hope of full support of a real Director game has not yet been realized, I&rsquo;ve helped to lay the foundations for that. With the foundational elements of Director and Lingo in place, if a bit more love is given to some individual games, full support should be easily attainable.</p>

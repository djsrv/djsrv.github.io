<p>After getting Bug Garden working, I began implementation of the bytecode versions of parent scripts and factories. For those not familiar with the Director engine, there are two ways we load Lingo scripts. From Director 2-3, Lingo was stored in Director movies as source code, which we parse and compile to custom bytecode. Starting in Director 4, Lingo was compiled to a <a href="http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Lingo_bytecode">bytecode</a> which is similar to our own, but it has a good number of differences. This bytecode is stored within movies' <code>Lscr</code> chunks, which also contain script metadata, much of which we don&rsquo;t yet handle. Due to the bytecode differences and unhandled metadata, parent scripts and factories only worked when the Lingo was loaded from source code, not from <code>Lscr</code>.</p>
<p>For this, I needed to get back to my Director roots, which started with reverse-engineering <code>Lscr</code> for the development of <a href="https://github.com/Earthquake-Project/ProjectorRays">ProjectorRays</a>, a Lingo bytecode decompiler. I already knew how to handle parent scripts from ProjectorRays, but factories were a mystery, so I needed to go back to the old strategy of incrementally changing test movies and watching what data changes. I&rsquo;ll spare you the fine details of how factories are stored, but basically scripts which contain factories are split into multiple <code>Lscr</code> chunks, with one chunk for each factory, and there&rsquo;s some metadata which ties these chunks together. With that work done, parent scripts and factories can now be loaded from bytecode.</p>
<p>I also did some more work with events, which I will continue this coming week. Last week I said that only one object is supposed to handle each event, which is only partially true. Sev pointed out that an event handler can call <code>pass</code>, which will pass the event to the next object in the chain of potential handlers, so I needed to make further changes to event delegation to handle that. Now I&rsquo;m in the process of checking event execution order against different versions of Director, and then it&rsquo;s on to implementing windows.</p>

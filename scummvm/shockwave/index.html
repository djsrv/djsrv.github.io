<p>None of the games I&rsquo;ve tested work very well yet due to missing Director features, but I&rsquo;m hoping that some Shockwave games will be fully playable soon, as they&rsquo;re often small and rather simple.</p>
<p>In addition, I&rsquo;ve refactored cast members so that they are Lingo objects, greatly simplifying the implementation of cast member properties. The properties a cast member has depends on its type, and this is now implemented with inheritance and polymorphism instead of a huge switch statement with copious type checks.</p>
<p>More types to follow! :)</p>

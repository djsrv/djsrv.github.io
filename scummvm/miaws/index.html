<p>Now new windows can be created/destroyed and hidden/shown with <code>open window &quot;ball&quot;</code>, <code>close window &quot;ball&quot;</code>, <code>forget window &quot;ball&quot;</code>, etc. There&rsquo;s still a good number of Lingo methods and properties to implement, and rendering issues which need to be sorted out, but for now I&rsquo;m focusing on fixing the large number of Buildbot errors which have recently piled up.</p>
<p>In particular, I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out how to handle duplicate script definitions in Majestic and other games, which has felt like a bit of a wild goose chase. After spending the weekend searching, I&rsquo;ve identified how to handle 6 of roughly 180 duplicate scripts, so I&rsquo;ll have to resume this hunt later.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m fixing up issues in the Lingo grammar, which is going much more smoothly. :)</p>

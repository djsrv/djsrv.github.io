			<p>Summer&rsquo;s drawing to a close, and the school year is about to begin. Before that happens, I&rsquo;m trying to squeeze in a few more tasks: exposing more Director features as Lingo objects, fully implementing chunk expressions, and cleaning up the implementations of Director 4 Lingo instructions.</p>
<p>One of the ways I&rsquo;ve tried to make the D4 instructions cleaner is by reducing code duplication. First, I cut down the size of <code>cb_objectcall</code> by reusing functionality in the generic <code>call</code>. Then, I noticed that several variable-related instructions take a variable type argument, but none of the instructions handled every variable type correctly. After identifying the IDs for every type I could, I combined all this duplicated variable lookup code into a single helper function.</p>
<p>I also implemented Lingo errors, allowing for easier detection of illegal cases, which often indicate a mistake on our part.</p>
<p>Then, I began implementing better support of chunk expressions. Chunk expressions are references to substrings, such as <code>word 2 to 4 of &quot;the quick brown fox&quot;</code>. You can use them to grab text:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>set x to word 2 to 4 of &quot;the quick brown fox&quot;`
</code></pre><p>or you can use them manipulate the text:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>put &quot; foo&quot; after word 2 of x
</code></pre><p>Previously, we only supported the former, and I&rsquo;m in the process of implementing support for the latter.</p>
<p>Since summer&rsquo;s almost over, I&rsquo;d like to thank the ScummVM developers, especially sev, rvanlaar, and moralrecordings, as well as Google for its Summer of Code program. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot and had a good deal of fun over the past three months.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be working on ScummVM full-time anymore, but this definitely won&rsquo;t be the last you hear from me. We still have plenty of work to do on Director, and I plan to keep contributing in my spare time.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>
